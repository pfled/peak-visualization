## Topics Discussed
- Adding a baseline to recordings (a low level of questions, like "is the sky blue")
  - Changing animation for heart rate level
  - The baseline will be a recording using more traditional monitoring techniques and that data will be provided for us
  - Adding data comparisons for those baselines
- Maybe some kind of visual effect like color to demonstrate the intensity of changes within the data

- Webapp: Visually interesting graphs, dynamically changing
  - Show baseline in recharts, highlight the spikes
  - Tie in some tagged simulation areas, show spikes related to coordinates in simulation
  - UTC timestamp to plan for expansion out of Eastern time zone
  - Add a 2D diagram to show where the eye gaze is at
  - Connecting to Client backends for data access

- Went over all documentation
  - User.md:
    - Add details about where headset data is saved to help other team with making data from lab available to us
- Get in contact with someone who is working on the simulation (Zeb, Rick?)

## Things Clarified

- Iteration two requirements
  - Get baseline for various biometrics and visualize them (Unity and webapp)
  - More interestingly visualized data in Unity app
    - Tell a "story" with the data (possible with changing colors)
    - Allow space for animation in future iterations
  - Webapp: Add anonymity options (i.e. show name vs. "user ID" in data select for administrator vs. manager)
  - Unity app: Allow user to user ID before submitting data (could be automated)
