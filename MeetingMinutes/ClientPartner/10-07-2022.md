* Data will be passed from headset to cloud, and our visualization engine will pull that data to visualize

* Use cases:
  * Set baseline so users can compare their own stress levels
  * Hardware: Visual simulation of how to cope
    * Biometric feedback to help users understand their stress levels

* Requirements:
  * Display data for biometric feedback in a visually pleasing way

* Business requirements:
  
  * Help people cope with stress
  * Help users what's causing users stress
  * Allow them to share if they need more support

  * Segmenting headset data (feed in demographics)
    * Ex.: Read user comfort level with male vs. female doctor

  * Anonymity preference feedback - How many people selected the privacy features?

  * Hardware: Visual simulation of how to cope
    * Biometric feedback to help users understand their stress levels
