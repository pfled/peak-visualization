## Topics Discussed

- Mockaroo: Mock data format for test visualizations
  - Can output to SQL format if wanting to test with Postgres
  - Could also just create JSON data, deserialize it, and visualize from there
- Tests
  - Cyprus for end-to-end tests, integration tests
  - Jest for unit testing
- Entity Framework Core
- Get things clarified with client, it can be frustrating to get stuck like this so communication is important

## Things Clarified
- Look into where HP SDK stores class information rather than just "namespaces" as described on the documentation to move past mocking data
