## Topics Discussed

* Checking code quality for WebApp frontend and backend since that was where the features were added.
    * Backend had a good setup. May need to look into avoiding syntactic sugar like oneliners.
    * Frontend looks much cleaner than mid iteration with seperating out api logic.
* Look into running unit tests within Docker containers to reduce setup.
* Playwrite or Cypress should be looked into so that we can do automated integration testing along with unit testing for the frontend.
    * Playwrite has a nice UI that you can simulate the functionality in and it will create the test code for you.
* Documentation should be in a better order for the dev setup.

## Things Clarified
* Issues with using regex for string formatting rather thank looksups.
    * The truncation level for a number string might be difficult to change.
