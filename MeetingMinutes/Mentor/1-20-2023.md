## Topics Discussed

- Spencer was caught up to speed on Tyler's visit to the Peak Mind lab
  - Alicia didn't want to discuss the web app much, more focused on implementing the Unity dashboard, which is diffucult for us in terms of finding new features to bring to the table for iteration three
- This mentor meeting was mostly focused on catching Spencer up on the current state of things because we don't see much of a clear path forward from the client
- Spencer's thoughts on current plan for backend:
  - C# has a static method for converting a file to a binary filestream 
   - Look for code examples where the new AWS link method is used, see how they implemented it
- Discussed frustration that senior project doesn't seem like it's ending up to be serious practical experience with programming--more just the basics of Unity?
  - Spencer reassured us that interviewers will find any sort of large project work valuable, and our project is definitely interesting (cutting-edge technology of VR headset biometric data)
  - Focus on VALUE of your project in interviews, not how "difficult" it was for you
    - How you saved corporations money/time

## Things Clarified
- Keep Ergin up to date on the client's focus, which for now seems unclear
- Read Spencer's linked article about how to present yourself in an interview
