## Topics Discussed

- Went over new game plan for second iteration, discussed whether mock AWS backend was a good direction to move in
  - Pointed out that it was a way to give functionality to the webapp and connect Unity/webapp portions of project
  - Spencer said it made sense but it would be a good idea to talk to professor Ergin and see if the other functional requirements given by client would be sufficient for an iteration
