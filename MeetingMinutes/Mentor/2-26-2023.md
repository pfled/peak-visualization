## Topics Discussed

- Told Spencer about our current progress
    - Still working on the backend login system
- Discussed our critiques from the previous iteration
    - We were told the software was not "useful" to the client
    - Spencer pointed out that Ergin is more honest and that business people are less direct and overly nice
- Spencer gave us advice related to our current situation but also useful for the future
    - Insisted that we read "Don't Call Yourself A Programmer" by Patrick McKenzie to better understand how to handle the business world 
    - Pointed out that there are no clear guidelines in the real world
    - Big companies are often bureaucracies and the stress of problems weighs heavier on you
    - Mid-sized companies are nicer in that way

## Things Clarified
- Spencer clarified that we should seriously consider whether our software is useful to the client and negotiate features rather than expect them
- Also clarified that we should deeply consider the size of the company we plan on working for
