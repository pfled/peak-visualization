## Topics Discussed

* Tyler signed up for HP SDK with all team member emails, still waiting for keys
* Tyler has been poking around Unity and checking out how to create 2D elements in Unity
* Not much room for optimization in Unity, seems mostly dependent on capabilities of hardware that the program is running on
* Is it actually possible to unit test the HP SDK?
* Git repo for Unity: Unity games must be compiled for each specific OS, so deciding what to include/ignore in repo might be complicated
* May use Unity teams instead: Collaboration across machines
  * Includes "Cloud Build": Optimizes and automates deploying across platforms
  * Uses Plastic SCM for version control

## Things Clarified
* Start learning about how to unit test in Unity
* Set up repositories for Unity: Look into Unity teams
