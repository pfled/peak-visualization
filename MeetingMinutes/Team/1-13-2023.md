## Topics Discussed

* Tyler recapped his visit to the new Peak Mind lab/office in Indianapolis
  * Meeting mostly went smoothly, but him and Alicia encountered some bugs that will need to be fixed quickly for the Unity app:
    * Truncate digits down to original precision, Unity is currently displaying way too many when fed data that isn't from the headset simulator
	    * Cognitive load: 2 digits post-decimal
	    * Eye gaze: 1 digit-post decimal
        * Heart rate is good
    * Update data on Unity dashboard less frequently: The headset sends data rapidly and in a steady stream. This causes the dashboard to act erratically
        * Dashboard update will need to be set to separate timer rather than changing every time a new data point is received
    * Manage file size of uploads due to 500MB HTTP limit on AWS gateway API
	    * Unity SDK should directly upload instead of going through API
	    * Live service?
    * Possibly get access to their AWS admin account with credit to use a paid service

## Things Clarified

* Research on the backend solution needs to begin ASAP so Alicia can be kept up-to-date

## Tasks Distributed

* Connor: Implement Unity quick fixes (digit truncation, less frequent updates)
* Tyler: Begin research on possible backend solution
