## Topics Discussed

Tyler has been working on multi-tier users backend:
* Needs to add making organization
* Created wrappers for admin and other authorization

Debated adding the multi-select data feature:
* Notetaker would need to be refactored
* However, individual datasets made the web app run too slow
* We decided this feature cannot be reasonably implemented

Dan - should add title of current dataset shown at the top outside of the dropdown

Discussed multi-tier user system and the pages needed on the frontend:
* The backend will return the route based on the user access tier:
    * Employee - /dashboard/:org/:user
        * Shows individual dashboard
    * Manager - /employees/:org
        * List of employees in organization
        * Each links to individual employee dashboard (/dashboard/:org/:user)
    * Admin - /admin/:id
        * View all organizations + users
        * Create/Delete organizations + users

* Discussed forgot password feature
    * Tyler will create user system first then work on this
    * Backend will:
    * Create jwt joken that expires within 15 min
    * Create url with token
    * Sends url to email that will allow them to change their password
    * Not a major priority
    * Tyler will give us send grid auth from Alicia

Tyler will build out requests for us to use for frontend and send the urls in slack.

Need to create an unauthorized page:
* "Not authorized page redirecting to…"


Connor - Admin
Dan - manager

Discussed reducing requests to AWS:
* Lookup table in database that stores user id with file names
* Save a list of datasets attached to users in the backend so we don't have to query aws

Connor is making new s3 bucket because we’ve almost reached our free limit on the current one:
* Tyler helped Connor set up the bucket 


## Things Clarified

* Plans for this iteration
* Where to host the new s3 bucket
* Which features are worth working on
* Which features have priority

## Tasks Distributed

* Connor: Frontend admin page
* Dan: Frontend tests + minor fixes
* Tyler: Finish user backend + forgot password if there's time
* Cody: Frontend manager page
