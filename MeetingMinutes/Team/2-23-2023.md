## Topics Discussed

* Tyler continuing work on getting the database setup for Flask backend, having trouble gettings migrations working properly
    * Until this is resolved it's best for the rest of us to stay working on the Unity app/React app
* Agreed that Tyler should not have to take on the entire backend for himself this iteration, delegating tasks for backend will be important
* Signed up for Symposium

## Things Clarified

* Tyler will finish up database migrations by end of weekend and work can start being distributed

## Tasks Distributed

* Connor: Continue work on Unity app: PPG panel, refactor datastore to be unit tested
    * DataStoreController needs to be implemented for more unit test coverage
* Cody: Implement filepath copy button in Unity app
* Tyler: Finish up SQL database migration so backend tasks can be delegated to entire team and work on authentication
