## Topics Discussed

* Tyler's progress on Flask backend:
    * Separated out to a model, view, controller architecture.
    * Unit testing is set up with Pytest
    * Models and db are made with Flask_SQLAlchemy
    * Using Flask_migrations for db migrations
    * There is an api config for development and testing (no production yet).
    * There is a `Makefile` for using `make` commands for common cli process like `make test` for running unit tests with code coverage.
    * `docker-compose` runs the frontend, backend, and mysql database.
    * Unit testing can cover entire request process including db interactions because it uses a db ran in memory.
    * Middleware was slightly more complicated to build than expected.
* Look into stateless authentication, JSON web tokens, cookies in Unity

## Things Clarified

* Once authentication system has been completed, an Admin system should be implemented

## Tasks Distributed
