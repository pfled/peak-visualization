## Topics Discussed

* Tyler could set up free-tier AWS to store headset JSON and mock connection to webapp (until client gives us access to theirs)
  * Store with user ID from Unity user select field, and datetime
    * Add dropdown menus to webapp to select data
* Keep DataSelect dropdown menu library in case client wants to be able to filter data in dropdowns one day (this is a feature of the library and not normal React dropdowns)
* Use external SVG filters to add gradients to line chart stroke--use this to highlight spikes

## Things Clarified

* We need AWS access from Alicia! It was a problem in the first iteration and is still a problem now
* Make better use of Github issues and project board
