## Topics Discussed

* Discussed Tech Stack assignment, laying out frameworks that we will use for front-end (AWS, React, Docker, JavaScript)
    * Decided on JavaScript over TypeScript
* Realized that it is difficult to get into specifics when it comes to the VR headset without clarification from Alicia on what the IU dev team is using (Unity, Unreal Engine, C++?)
    * Researched how each is integrated into the HP SDK, just in case
* Created HP Developer accounts to prepare for our meeting with Alicia, unsure if we will need special access for Omnicept SDK
