## Topics Discussed

* Discuss possible moves for final iteration: A full-blown backend instead of waiting on Peak Mind integration
  * The hope is that we will make something that is easily deployable into their AWS environment whenever they're ready for it, even if it's after the school year ends
* Backend would probably be set up as a microservice
  * Possible candidates:
    * PHP (Laravell)
    * Python (Flask)
    * Node (Express)
  * Python seems most likely as it's good for data manipulation/storage, and we're all familiar with it
    * Also, according to the original Peak Mind architecture diagram sent by Alicia, they already use a Python API for their data storage solution 
  * All these options are microframeworks so they would be very lightweight, but a lot of work would be on us

## Things Clarified

* Plans for iteration 4

## Tasks Distributed

* Tasks are same as last week's meeting, simply finish all the proposed features for iteration 3
