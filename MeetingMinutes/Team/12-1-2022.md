## Topics Discussed

* Discussed API buildt using the AWS CDK using AWS Lambda, APIGateway, and S3 services.
* How the free tier of AWS works.
* Information on getting the Unity application and WebApp connected to the API. What routes/functionality there was for each and how to make said requests in the respective languages/frameworks for the different applications.
* Wether we should risk AWS charges to implement a service for user authentication and accounts on our account. We ultimately decided not to due to the amount of effort compared to the time left in the semester along with the fact that it would be removed in favor for the Client's user service when we are able to connect to it.


## Things Clarified

* C#/Unity HTTP requests.
* AWS services being used and how to view them in the management console.
