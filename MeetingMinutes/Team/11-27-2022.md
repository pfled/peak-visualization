## Topics Discussed

* Game plan
  * Create our own AWS resources for connecting Unity and webapp portions of our project
    * This is due to a long wait time on a meeting with the client and we are still unable to access their current system
  * Utilize free tier of AWS to create a mock backend using AWS Lambda and AWS S3
    * A folder of data will be created for each user, based on their User ID which will be an input field in the Unity app
    * Webapp will be able to make a request to Lambda to get all of the data sets for that user
    * JSON will be saved to S3 through HTTP request to Lambda by Unity
    * Simple Lambda setup will prevent us from needing to make massive changes once we get access to client's current environment

## Things Clarified

* Tyler: Set up AWS resources
* Connor: Add user ID input element to Unity GUI and build Lambda HTTP request once Tyler has finished setup
* Cody: Start setting up unit testing for Unity
