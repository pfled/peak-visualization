# Experience

Overall I enjoyed presenting at the student symposium. It felt like there was a lot of standing around however.
I wish there had been more people that came to talk to us during the time that we were there. I also enjoyed seeing some of the projects
from people in other disciplines around Ball State. I also wish that I had looked more at the schedule and made time for to attend
an oral presentation while I was there.
