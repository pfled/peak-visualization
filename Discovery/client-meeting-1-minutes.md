## Topics Discussed

* Alicia sent YouTube news clip (from this morning!) that describes how they’ve been using the HP SDK

* https://youtu.be/VZuVuN_vnIM

* https://fox59.com/indy-now/workplace-mental-health/

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9doSDqbdMjM

  
* UI/UX basically already designed

* Main focus: HP SDK setup

    * See data in real time

    * We are essentially working with cutting edge technology that is in its “pilot phase"

    * Team could come down to Indy at some point and check out the headsets

* Specifics of headset

    * Retinopathy—see blood pressure through retinas, tracking heart rate variability and cognitive load to determine stress levels

    * Also tracks eye gaze to determine what user is most focused on and use that information to find most effective strategies

    * Biometrics can be used to target specific individuals that need more mental health assistance

    * Internet latency will affect speed of delivery of stress relief tool—Verizon is assisting in that with their 5G connection

    * Data processing is intense: Powerful HP Zbooks are necessary for using the headset

  

* Hackathon next year?

* Visualizations should be fairly quick and easy

* UI/UX implementation is for an existing webapp

    * Important visual UI element is to make clear that user privacy is a heavy focus

* Framework: Mostly JavaScript with a little bit of Python

* Visualization will be separate for now, then will be integrated into data pipeline, work with their simulations and applications

    * Not building simulations for the headset: Just working with the data and visualizing it

   * Simulations are AR/VR-heavy, project more made for IU “gaming” students

* Ideally, we would reach the level of visualization seen in the YouTube videos

* Colin: A data scientist we will have contact with to integrate our parts of the project into their simulations and applications.

* Group solo discussion (post-Alicia leaving)

   * Prototyping—what do we need to lay out since we are basically diving in to Peak Mind’s already existing ecosystem?


## Things Clarified

* Alicia will send us Figma architectural sketch

* Need access to HRIS data visualization webapp and AWS (we need accounts)—production and staging areas

* Meet in a week, check that we can access everything and find out what support we need in order to make a better plan

* Meeting time next week: Friday at 1-2

* Alicia phone number: (317) 201-2436

* Get added to the ClickUp group
